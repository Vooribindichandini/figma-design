The Sheets Library, which is Page-1 of the application, offers various features to manage smart sheets. Users can find a dropdown to filter sheets linked to specific assets and their sub-assets, enabling efficient organization. Additionally, there's a clear Call-to-Action (CTA) button to author a new sheet from scratch. When clicked, a modal opens, providing users with the option to "author from scratch" or "choose from templates" to streamline the sheet creation process. After entering the sheet details in the modal fields, users can proceed to Page-2, the Authoring Module. This page includes a left section called "Fields," housing all the available fields for sheet authoring. Users can easily drag and drop the desired fields onto the canvas located at the center. The canvas allows users to resize and delete fields as needed. For this assignment, only "section," "checklist," and "date picker" fields should be functional. Users can effortlessly drag and drop these fields onto the canvas, customizing each one with a title (string). For the "checklist" field, users can add or remove checklist option tabs, name the options, and check or uncheck them. Similarly, the "date picker" field requires integration with a date picker component, allowing users to choose specific dates when placed on the canvas. On the extreme right section labeled "controls," users can select any field from the canvas and configure various controls. They can check or uncheck the "required status" of the field and use a small toggle switch to turn the "trigger status" on or off. Once the authoring is complete, users can save their work by clicking the "finish authoring" button. Upon saving, users are directed back to Page-1 (Sheets Library) where the authored sheet is now present. They can open the sheet and further modify it as needed. Throughout the assignment, the intern is expected to replicate the Figma prototype as closely as possible, ensuring a seamless and well-designed React web application within the given design system. Additional efforts to enhance functionality and interactivity will earn bonus points. T
